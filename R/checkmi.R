#' Inspect multiple imputation model
#'
#' Check multiple imputation is valid under the proposed imputation model and
#' directed acyclic graph (DAG). Validity means that the proposed approach will
#' allow unbiased estimation of the estimand(s) of interest, including
#' regression parameters, associations, and causal effects. The imputation model
#' should include all other analysis model variables as predictors, as well as
#' any auxiliary variables. The DAG should include all observed and unobserved
#' variables related to the analysis model variables and their missingness, as
#' well as all required missingness indicators.
#'
#' In principle, multiple imputation is valid if each partially observed
#' variable is unrelated to its own missingness, given its imputation model
#' predictors.

#' @param dep The partially observed variable to be imputed, specified as a
