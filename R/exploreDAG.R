#' Compares data with proposed DAG
#'
#' Explore whether relationships between fully observed variables in the
#' specified dataset are consistent with the proposed directed acyclic graph
#' (DAG) using \link[dagitty]{localTests} functionality.
#'
#' @param mdag The DAG, specified as a string using \link[dagitty]{dagitty}
#'   syntax, or as a \link[dagitty]{dagitty} graph object
#' @param data Optionally, a data frame containing all the variables stated in
#'   the DAG. All ordinal variables must be integer-coded and all categorical
#'   variables must be dummy-coded.
#'
#' @return A message listing the pairs of variables that are implied to be
#'   independent (possibly conditional on other variables) by the proposed DAG.
#'   Optionally, if a dataset is supplied, a message indicating whether the
#'   relationships between fully observed variables in the specified dataset are
#'   consistent with the proposed DAG.
