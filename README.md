## Overview

The Multiple Imputation DOCtor (`midoc`) R package is a guidance system
for analysis with missing data. It incorporates expert, up-to-date
methodology to help you choose the most appropriate analysis method when
there are missing data. By examining the available data and the assumed
causal structure, `midoc` will advise whether multiple imputation is
needed, and if so, how best to perform it.

- `descMissData` lists missing data patterns in the specified dataset

- `exploreDAG` compares the relationships in the available data with the
  proposed DAG

- `checkCRA` checks complete records analysis is valid under the
  proposed analysis model

- `checkMI` checks multiple imputation is valid under the proposed
  imputation model

- `checkModSpec` explores the parametric specification of the imputation
  model

- `proposeMI` suggests multiple imputation options based on the
  available data and specified imputation model

- `doMImice` performs multiple imputation based on the `proposeMI`
  options

You can learn more about these commands in `vignette("midoc","midoc")`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of midoc from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elliecurnow/midoc")
```
