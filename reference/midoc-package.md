# midoc: A Decision-Making System for Multiple Imputation

A guidance system for analysis with missing data. It incorporates
expert, up-to-date methodology to help researchers choose the most
appropriate analysis approach when some data are missing. You provide
the available data and the assumed causal structure, including the
likely causes of missing data. 'midoc' will advise which analysis
approaches can be used, and how best to perform them. 'midoc' follows
the framework for the treatment and reporting of missing data in
observational studies (TARMOS). Lee et al (2021).
