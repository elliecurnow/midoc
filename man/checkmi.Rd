\title{Inspect multiple imputation model}
\usage{
checkMI(dep, preds, r_dep, mdag)
}
\arguments{
\item{dep}{The partially observed variable to be imputed, specified as a
string}

\item{preds}{The imputation model predictor(s), specified as a string (space
delimited)}

\item{r_dep}{The partially observed variable's missingness indicator,
specified as a string}

\item{mdag}{The DAG, specified as a string using \link[dagitty]{dagitty}
syntax}
}
\value{
A message indicating whether multiple imputation is valid under the
proposed DAG and imputation model
}
\description{
Check multiple imputation is valid under the proposed imputation model and
directed acyclic graph (DAG). Validity means that the proposed approach will
allow unbiased estimation of the estimand(s) of interest, including
regression parameters, associations, and causal effects. The imputation model
should include all other analysis model variables as predictors, as well as
any auxiliary variables. The DAG should include all observed and unobserved
variables related to the analysis model variables and their missingness, as
well as all required missingness indicators.
}
\details{
In principle, multiple imputation is valid if each partially observed
variable is unrelated to its own missingness, given its imputation model
predictors.

\examples{
# Example DAG for which multiple imputation is valid, because collider
## variable 'bwt' is not included as a predictor
checkMI(dep="bmi7", preds="matage mated pregsize", r_dep="r",
        mdag="matage -> bmi7 mated -> matage mated -> bmi7
              sep_unmeas -> mated sep_unmeas -> r pregsize -> bmi7
              pregsize -> bwt sep_unmeas -> bwt")

# Example DAG for which multiple imputation is not valid
checkMI(dep="bmi7", preds="matage", r_dep="r",
        mdag="matage -> bmi7 mated -> matage mated -> bmi7
               sep_unmeas -> mated sep_unmeas -> r")
