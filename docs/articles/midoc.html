</h2>
<p>Missing data is a common issue in health and social research, often
addressed by multiple imputation (MI). MI is a flexible and general
approach, with a suite of software packages. However, using MI in
practice can be complex. Application of MI involves multiple decisions
which are rarely justified or even documented, and for which little
guidance is available.</p>
<p>The Multiple Imputation DOCtor (<code>midoc</code>) R package is a
decision-making system which incorporates expert, up-to-date guidance to
help you choose the most appropriate analysis method when there are
missing data. <code>midoc</code> will guide you through your analysis,
examining both the hypothesised causal relationships and the observed
data to advise on whether MI is needed, and if so how to perform it.
<code>midoc</code> follows the framework for the treatment and reporting
of missing data in observational studies (TARMOS) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.01.008" class="external-link">1</a>. We assume
you are interested in obtaining unbiased estimates of regression
coefficients - note that bias is not necessarily a concern if your
interest is in prediction (<em>i.e.</em> diagnostic/prognostic
modelling).</p>
<p>Here, we will demonstrate the key features of <code>midoc</code>
using a worked example.</p>
<p>In this example, we wish to estimate the association between maternal
age at first pregnancy (our exposure) and child’s body mass index (BMI)
at age 7 years (our outcome). For simplicity, we only consider one
confounder of the relationship between maternal age and BMI at age 7
years, maternal education level. Note that simulated data for this study
are included in the <code>midoc</code> package in the <code>bmi</code>
dataset. The dataset contains 1000 observations, with realistic values
for each variable, and exaggerated relationships between variables (to
highlight the consequences of our choice of analysis approach).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> An interactive version of this vignette:
<em>Multiple Imputation DOCtor (midoc) Shiny version</em> is also
available to run locally (you can run this using the <code>midoc</code>
command <code><a href="../reference/midocVignette.html">midocVignette()</a></code>). In the interactive version, you
can apply features of <code>midoc</code> described here using your own
DAG and data.</p>
<p>You can also explore <code>midoc</code> functions interactively using
the (browser-based) <a href="https://elliecurnow.shinyapps.io/midocshinyapp/" class="external-link">midoc Shiny
app</a>.</p>

acyclic graph<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-1-specify-the-analysis-and-missingness-models-using-a-directed-acyclic-graph"></a>
</h2>
<p>First, we will construct a causal diagram, or directed acyclic graph
(DAG) for our example, using syntax as per the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyw341" class="external-link">dagitty</a> package.</p>
<p>We will start by specifying the relationships between our variables,
assuming there are no missing data.</p>
<p>We will assume maternal age (<code>matage</code>) causes BMI at age 7
years (<code>bmi7</code>), and maternal education level
(<code>mated</code>) causes both maternal age and BMI at age 7 years. We
can express these relationships using “dagitty” syntax, as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">matage</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">bmi7</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">mated</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">matage</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">mated</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">bmi7</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, for each partially observed variable, we will specify the
variables related to its probability of being missing (its
“missingness”) by adding these relationships to our DAG. This type of
DAG is often referred to as a “missingness” DAG (mDAG) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280210394469" class="external-link">2</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyad008" class="external-link">3</a>.</p>
<p>We will first use the <code>midoc</code> function
<code>descMissData</code> to identify which variables in our dataset are
partially observed, specifying our outcome (<code>y</code>), covariates,
<em>i.e.</em> our independent variables, (<code>covs</code>), and
dataset (<code>data</code>), as follows.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/descMissData.html">descMissData</a></span><span class="op">(</span>y<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"bmi7"</span>, </span>
<span>             covs<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"matage mated"</span>, </span>
<span>             data<span class="op">=</span><span class="va">bmi</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>  pattern bmi7 matage mated   n pct
1       1    1      1     1 592  59
2       2    0      1     1 408  41</code></pre>
<p>We see that there are two missing data patterns: either all variables
are observed, or BMI at age 7 years is missing and all covariates are
observed. We will use indicator variable “R” to denote the missingness
of BMI at age 7 years (for example, R=1 if BMI at age 7 years is
observed, and 0 otherwise). In this specific example, R also indicates a
complete record (R=1 if all variables are fully observed, and 0
otherwise) because all other variables are fully observed. We will
suppose that R is related to maternal education level via socio-economic
position (SEP), <em>i.e.</em> SEP is a cause of both maternal education
level and R, but neither BMI at age 7 years itself nor maternal age are
causes of R. We will further suppose that SEP is missing (unmeasured)
for all individuals in our dataset; to remind us of this fact, we will
name this variable <code>sep_unmeas</code>.</p>
<p>Our mDAG is now as follows (note that we follow the convention of
using lower case names for variables in our code, so R becomes “r”, and
so on):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">matage</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">bmi7</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">mated</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">matage</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">mated</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">bmi7</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">sep_unmeas</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">mated</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">sep_unmeas</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">r</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that if instead you believe maternal education is a direct cause
of R, the mDAG would be as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">matage</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">bmi7</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">mated</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">matage</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">mated</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">bmi7</span> </span>
<span><span class="va">mated</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="va">r</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We will now draw our mDAG and visually check that the relationships
are specified as we intended:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We have used additional commands to specify the
layout of the mDAG shown below - although this is not necessary when
using <code>midoc</code>, go to the dagitty <a href="https://www.dagitty.net/" class="external-link">website</a> if you would like to find
out more about using “dagitty” to draw mDAGs.</p>
<p><img src="midoc_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="500px" height="400px"></p>
<p>As a final check of our mDAG, we will use the <code>midoc</code>
function <code>exploreDAG</code> to explore whether relationships in the
dataset are consistent with the proposed mDAG, specifying both our mDAG
(<code>mdag</code>) and dataset (<code>data</code>), as follows.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/exploreDAG.html">exploreDAG</a></span><span class="op">(</span>mdag<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"matage -&gt; bmi7 </span></span>

<span><span class="st">                  mated -&gt; bmi7 </span></span>
<span><span class="st">                  sep_unmeas -&gt; mated </span></span>

<span>           data<span class="op">=</span><span class="va">bmi</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>The proposed directed acyclic graph (DAG) implies the following
conditional independencies (where, for example, 'X _||_ Y | Z' should
be read as 'X is independent of Y conditional on Z'). Note that
variable names are abbreviated:

bmi7 _||_ r | sp_n

bmi7 _||_ r | matd

bmi7 _||_ sp_n | matd

matg _||_ r | sp_n

matg _||_ r | matd

matg _||_ sp_n | matd

matd _||_ r | sp_n

These (conditional) independence statements are explored below using
the canonical correlations approach for mixed data. See
??dagitty::localTests for further details.  Results are shown for
variables that are fully observed in the specified dataset. The null
hypothesis is that the stated variables are (conditionally)
independent.

                        estimate  p.value        2.5%      97.5%

matage _||_ r | mated 0.02998323 0.343547 -0.03206946 0.09180567

Interpretation: A small p-value means the stated variables may not be
(conditionally) independent in the specified dataset: your data may not
be consistent with the proposed DAG. A large p-value means there is
little evidence of inconsistency between your data and the proposed
DAG.

Note that these results assume that relationships between variables are
linear. Consider exploring the specification of each relationship in
your model.  Also consider whether it is valid and possible to explore
relationships between partially observed variables using the observed
data, e.g. avoiding perfect prediction.</code></pre>
<p>Based on the relationships between fully observed variables maternal
age, maternal education, and missingness of BMI at age 7 years, we can
see that there is little evidence of inconsistency between our dataset
and proposed mDAG. In particular, our mDAG assumes that maternal age
(<code>matage</code>) is unrelated to missingness of BMI at age 7 years
(<code>r</code>), given maternal education (<code>mated</code>); our
results suggest this is plausible. Note that we cannot use our observed
data to determine whether BMI at age 7 years is unrelated to its own
missingness - we would need the missing values of BMI at age 7 years in
order to do this. However, if BMI at age 7 years was a cause of its own
missingness, then we would expect maternal age also to be related to its
missingness (via BMI at age 7 years). Since maternal age seems to be
unrelated, we are reassured that BMI at age 7 years is also likely to be
unrelated, given maternal education.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for specifying a “missingness” DAG</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First specify the DAG for the analysis model, as it would be if
there were no missing data. You may find this introduction to DAGs
useful <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0071-3" class="external-link">4</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next add missingness indicator(s) to your DAG. If you have
multiple variables with missing data, you may want to start by including
just the complete records indicator in your DAG.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Identify variables related to missingness using:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Subject-matter knowledge, for example, prior research on causes
of drop-out in your study and knowledge of the data collection
process</p></li>
<li><p>Data exploration, for example, by performing a logistic
regression of each missingness indicator on your analysis model
variables - noting that you may have to exclude any variables with a
large proportion of missing data to avoid perfect prediction</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

</h2>
<p>Our next step is to determine whether complete records analysis (CRA)
is a valid strategy, using our mDAG. Remember that, in general, CRA will
be valid if the analysis model outcome is unrelated to the complete
records indicator, conditional on the analysis model covariates <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyz032" class="external-link">5</a> (in special cases,
depending on the type of analysis model and estimand of interest, this
rule can be relaxed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwv114" class="external-link">6</a> -
here, we will consider the general setting without making any
assumptions about the fitted model).</p>
<p>Suppose we decide to estimate the unadjusted association between BMI
at age 7 years and maternal age, without including our confounder
maternal education in the model. We will use the <code>midoc</code>
function <code>checkCRA</code> applied to our mDAG to check whether CRA
is valid for this model, specifying our outcome (<code>y</code>),
covariates, <em>i.e.</em> our independent variables,
(<code>covs</code>), complete records indicator (<code>r_cra</code>),
and mDAG (<code>mdag</code>), as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span><span class="st">               sep_unmeas -&gt; r"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>Based on the proposed directed acyclic graph (DAG), the analysis model
outcome and complete record indicator are not independent given
analysis model covariates. Hence, in general, complete records analysis
is not valid.

In special cases, depending on the type of analysis model and estimand
of interest, complete records analysis may still be valid. See, for
example, Bartlett et al. (2015) (https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwv114)
for further details.

Consider using a different analysis model and/or strategy, e.g.
multiple imputation.

For example, the analysis model outcome and complete record indicator
are independent if, in addition to the specified covariates, the
following sets of variables are included as covariates in the analysis
model (note that this list is not necessarily exhaustive, particularly
if your DAG is complex):

mated

c("mated", "sep_unmeas")</code></pre>
<p>We can see that CRA would not be valid (we can also tell this by
inspecting our DAG: there is an open path from <code>bmi7</code> to
<code>r</code> via <code>mated</code> and <code>sep_unmeas</code> if we
only condition on <code>matage</code>). <code>checkCRA</code> suggests
that CRA would be valid if we included <code>mated</code>, or
<code>mated</code> and <code>sep_unmeas</code>, in the analysis model.
In this particular setting, it is sensible to include <code>mated</code>
in the analysis model since it is a confounder of the relationship
between <code>matage</code> and <code>bmi7</code>. In other settings, we
might not want to include the variables required for valid CRA in our
model because they might change its interpretation - in that case, we
would need to use a different analysis strategy. Note that
<code>sep_unmeas</code> is not related to <code>bmi7</code> once we
condition on <code>mated</code> (though it is still related to
missingness of <code>bmi7</code>), so does not need to be included in
our analysis model.</p>
<p>If we add <code>mated</code> to the model and re-run
<code>checkCRA</code>, as below, we see that CRA is now valid.</p>

<p>Although CRA is valid for our example, we may also wish to perform
MI. Remember that MI is valid in principle if each partially observed
variable is unrelated to its missingness, given its imputation model
predictors. Furthermore, we should include all other analysis model
variables in the imputation model for each partially observed variable,
in the form implied by the analysis model, so that the analysis and
imputation models are “compatible”. In theory, given multiple partially
observed variables, validity of MI may imply different causes of
missingness for each missing data pattern. For example, if both BMI at
age 7 years and maternal education were partially observed, MI would
only be valid if missingness of BMI at age 7 years was unrelated to
maternal education among individuals missing both BMI at age 7 years and
maternal education (given the other observed data). Missingness of BMI
at age 7 years could be related to maternal education among individuals
with observed maternal education. In practice, we recommend focusing on
the most common missing data patterns and/or variables with the most
missing data. Less common missing data patterns can often be assumed to
be missing completely at random - it is unlikely to change your final
conclusions if this assumption is incorrect.</p>
<p>In our example, we only have a single partially observed variable
(BMI at age 7 years), so it is relatively simple to check the validity
of MI based on our mDAG. We have already verified (using
<code>checkCRA</code>) that BMI at age 7 years is unrelated to its
missingness, given maternal age and maternal education. Therefore, we
know that MI will be valid if we use only these variables in the
imputation model for BMI at age 7 years (because the analysis model and
the imputation model are exactly the same in this case). However, MI
using just maternal age and maternal education in the imputation model
for BMI at age 7 years will recover no additional information compared
to CRA. Therefore, we may wish to include “auxiliary variables” in our
imputation model for BMI at age 7 years. These are additional variables
that are included as predictors in the imputation model but that are not
required for the analysis model. If we choose auxiliary variables that
are predictive of BMI at age 7 years, we can improve the precision of
our MI estimate - reduce its standard error - compared to the CRA
estimate.</p>
<p>In our example, we have two variables that could be used as auxiliary
variables: pregnancy size - singleton or multiple birth -
(<code>pregsize</code>) and birth weight (<code>bwt</code>). We will
inspect the missing data patterns in our dataset once again using
<code>descMissData</code>, including our auxiliary variables.</p>

Interpretation: A small p-value means the stated variables may not be
(conditionally) independent in the specified dataset: your data may not
be consistent with the proposed DAG. A large p-value means there is
little evidence of inconsistency between your data and the proposed
DAG.

Note that these results assume that relationships between variables are
linear. Consider exploring the specification of each relationship in
your model.  Also consider whether it is valid and possible to explore
relationships between partially observed variables using the observed
data, e.g. avoiding perfect prediction.</code></pre>

The results are shown below. These suggest that MI would not be valid if

inspecting our mDAG: since <code>bwt</code> shares a common cause with
both <code>bmi7</code> and <code>r</code>, it is a “collider”, and hence

<pre><code>Based on the proposed directed acyclic graph (DAG), the incomplete
variable and its missingness indicator are not independent given
imputation model predictors. Hence, multiple imputation methods which
assume data are missing at random are not valid.

Consider using a different imputation model and/or strategy (e.g.
not-at-random fully conditional specification).  For example, the
incomplete variable and its missingness indicator are independent if,
in addition to the specified predictors, the following sets of
variables are included as predictors in the imputation model (note that
this list is not necessarily exhaustive, particularly if your DAG is
complex):

pregsize

c("pregsize", "sep_unmeas")</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In theory, and as suggested by the
<code>checkMI</code> results shown above, MI would be valid if we added
both birth weight and pregnancy size as auxiliary variables in our
imputation model (note that SEP is not needed, conditional on the other
imputation model predictors). However, in practice, this strategy may
still result in biased estimates, due to unmeasured confounding of the
relationship between BMI at age 7 years and birth weight. We recommend
not including colliders of the partially observed variable and its
missingness as auxiliary variables <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fepid.2023.1237447" class="external-link">7</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>So far, we have explored whether CRA and MI are valid <em>in
principle</em> using our mDAG, without making any assumptions about the
form of our variables, or their relationships with each other.</p>
<p>However, for MI to give unbiased estimates, imputation models must be
both compatible with the analysis model and correctly specified: they
must contain all the variables required for the analysis model, they
must include all relationships implied by the analysis model
e.g. interactions, and they must specify the form of all relationships
correctly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2023.06.011" class="external-link">8</a>.</p>
<p>Since CRA and MI are valid in principle for our worked example, we
will use the complete records in the <code>bmi</code> dataset to explore
the specification of relationships between BMI at age 7 years and its
predictors (the analysis model variables, maternal age and maternal
education, plus auxiliary variable, pregnancy size) in its imputation
model.</p>
<p>We will use the <code>midoc</code> function <code>checkModSpec</code>
applied to the <code>bmi</code> dataset to check whether our imputation
model is correctly specified. We will specify the formula for the
imputation model using standard R syntax (<code>formula</code>), the
type of imputation model (<code>family</code>) (note that
<code>midoc</code> currently supports either linear or logistic
regression models), and the name of the dataset (<code>data</code>).</p>
<p>Since maternal education and pregnancy size are binary variables, we
only need to explore the form of the relationship between BMI at age 7
years and our continuous exposure, maternal age. We will first assume
there is a linear relationship between BMI at age 7 years and maternal
age (note, this is the default in most software implementations of MI).
We will assume there are no interactions.</p>
<p>The results are shown below. These suggest that our imputation model
is mis-specified. A plot of the residuals versus the fitted values from
our model (which is automatically displayed if there is evidence of
model mis-specification), suggests there may be a quadratic relationship
between BMI at age 7 years and maternal age.</p>

<p>We have explored both the validity of MI in principle, using our
mDAG, and the specification of our imputation model, based on our
observed data. We will now use the <code>midoc</code> function
<code>proposeMI</code> to choose the best options when performing MI
using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v045.i03" class="external-link">mice</a>
package. We will first save our chosen imputation model (<em>i.e.</em>
specifying a quadratic relationship between BMI at age 7 years and
maternal age) as a <code>mimod</code> object. Note we have suppressed
the <code>checkModSpec</code> message in this case using the
<code>message = FALSE</code> option. We will then use this, along with
our dataset, to construct our call of the “mice” function. Note we will
also save our proposed “mice” call as a <code>miprop</code> object, to
be used later.</p>
<p>The results are shown below. In particular, note that in the proposed
“mice” call, the default values for the number of imputations, method,
formulas, and number of iterations have been changed. Plots of the
distributions of imputed and observed data, based on a sample of five
imputed datasets, suggest that extreme values are handled appropriately
using the proposed imputation method. Trace plots, showing the mean and
standard deviation of the imputed values across iterations, are also
displayed. Note that both plots are shown without prompting
(<code>plotprompt = FALSE</code>). There is no need to adjust the number
of iterations when, as in our dataset, only one variable is partially
observed.</p>

if there is a trend that does not stabilise by the 10th iteration. Note
that iteration is not performed when only one variable is partially
observed.

<p><strong>Note</strong> Given multiple partially observed variables, we
can specify a list of imputation models - one for each partially
observed variable - in <code>proposeMI</code>. For example, suppose
pregnancy size was also partially observed. We will assume, for
simplicity, that pregnancy size was missing completely at random. Then
we could construct our proposed “mice” call using
<code>proposeMI</code>, as follows. Here, we again suppress the model
checking messages.</p>

<p>Returning to our example, we will assume no further adjustment is
required to the proposed “mice” call. We will use the <code>midoc</code>
function <code>doMImice</code> to perform MI, specifying our proposed
“mice” call (<code>miprop</code>) and the seed for our “mice” call
(<code>seed</code>) (so that our results are reproducible). We will also
specify our substantive model of interest (<code>substmod</code>): a
regression of BMI at 7 years on maternal age (fitting a quadratic
relationship) and maternal education. This is an optional step: if we
specify the substantive model, it will be fitted automatically to each
imputed dataset and the pooled results will be displayed (equivalent to
using the “mice” functions <code>with</code> and <code>pool</code>). If
the substantive model is not specified, only the imputation step will be
performed.</p>

<p>Finally, we illustrate how our choice of analysis approach affects
the estimated association between maternal age and BMI at age 7 years,
adjusted for maternal education level. We compare CRA and MI estimates.
When performing MI, we used either pregnancy size or birth weight as an
auxiliary variable and fitted either a linear or quadratic relationship
between BMI at age 7 years and maternal age in the imputation model. For
each analysis approach, we fitted the same substantive analysis model
that we used above.</p>
<p>The parameter estimates for the linear and quadratic terms of
maternal age, and their 95% confidence intervals, are shown in the table
below. Note that, because we have simulated the data and its
missingness, we know the “true” association <em>i.e.</em> the
association if there were no missing data - this is shown in the “Full
data” row of the table. Further note that the results displayed in the
third row (“MI fitting quadratic relationship, using pregnancy size”)
are exactly those generated above. To avoid repetition, we have not
shown the code for fitting the other models.</p>
<p>From the table, we can see that both CRA and MI (fitting a quadratic
relationship between BMI at age 7 years and maternal age in the
imputation model) estimates are unbiased for both the linear and
quadratic terms of maternal age. MI estimates are biased when fitting a
linear relationship in the imputation model, particularly for the
quadratic term of maternal age. MI estimates using the collider, birth
weight, as an auxiliary variable are slightly more biased and slightly
less precise than the estimates using pregnancy size as an auxiliary
variable. The collider bias is relatively small because the association
between BMI at age 7 years and maternal age is strong in this setting.
Note that the collider bias could be relatively larger if the
association was weak <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fepid.2023.1237447" class="external-link">9</a>.</p>
